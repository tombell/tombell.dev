      <h1>Tom Bell &mdash; Software Engineer</h1>

      <p>
        Currently working for <a href="https://residently.com">Residently</a> as
        a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I'm been writing code since the late 90's, when I first tinkered around
        with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC">BASIC</a>
        on the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have learnt numerous languages, frameworks, and
        platforms. These days you can generally find me writing <b>Go</b>,
        <b>Swift</b>, and <b>TypeScript</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>

      <p>
        My choice of laptop is a 13" MacBook Pro (Intel), running the latest
        iteration of macOS.
      </p>

      <p>
        When working from my desk, an IKEA Linnmon, I use an external
        Dell monitor which doubles as my USB hub. I plug my keyboard, webcam,
        microphone, and DAC/amp into the monitor, then I have 2 USB-C cables
        going into my laptop, and another for the MacBook charger.
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Software</h2>

      <p>
        I stick to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/">macOS</a> for my
        operating system, as I've used exclusively Mac products for the last 10
        years. It gives me the access to most UNIX tools, while not requiring
        effort to make look good.
      </p>

      <h3>Applications</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Browser:</b>
          <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html">Google Chrome</a>,
          the reason for this is that Safari doesn't quite have an ad blocker
          available that can consistently block ads on YouTube and Twitch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Email:</b>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mail">Apple Mail</a>,
          which is hooked up to my Google Workplace (formly Google for Domains)
          account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Messaging:</b>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messages_(Apple)">Apple Messages</a>
          and
          <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chat:</b>
          <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Music:</b>
          <a href="https://brushedtype.co/doppler/">Doppler</a>, the simplest
          and best <b>native</b> music player I've found on Mac for playing FLAC
          files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Video:</b>
          <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a>, mostly because of its minimal user
          interface and ability to play every video format I throw at it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Terminal:</b>
          <a href="https://alacritty.org/">Alacritty</a>, which I switched to
          after using iTerm for a number of years. Alacritty won out over Kitty
          because it was the <i>lighter</i> of the two, and was quicker to get
          set up in my preferred way.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Terminal Applications</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Text editor:</b>
          <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> has been my text editor
          exclusively for the last few years, and previous was Vim. I originally
          switched to Neovim due to the number of improvements it brought with
          it. I've since stayed with Neovim due to the great things it has
          added, such as built in LSP support, and using Lua for scripting and
          configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Terminal multiplexer:</b>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">Tmux</a> is a recent
          addition to my workflow in the last couple of years. I used to use a
          lot of splits and tabs in iTerm, however decided to utilise Tmux more.
          With switching to Alacritty (which has no tabs or splits), using Tmux
          allows me to generally stay in a single terminal window.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Source control:</b>
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, it's the most ubiquitous
          source control application right now, and
          <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> the standard for hosted
          repositories.
